# Defense

### Notes from Likeafox attack

* Factor tough parts and boosts into target selection and tower halt fire decision
* Use ramparts in walls
* Station attack part defense in ramparts
* Limit defenders to inside of base footprint
* Handle base destruction better
  * Removed old buildings sites
  * Decide when to give up
* Defense response must be global, nearby bases need to respond
